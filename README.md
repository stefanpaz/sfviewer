# SFViewer (0.0.1)

This is a basic app that connects to a Salesforce environment using oAuth and provides a list of objects and their definitions to browse, without using any frameworks or external libraries. This is purely a personal project for learning purposes at the moment, as you could achieve this much quicker using Express and JSforce. In its early state, the code is simply a proof of concept and has not been cleaned up, modularized, or even commented well. I'm not sure how far I'll take this, but I'll probably improve this occasionally as time allows.
